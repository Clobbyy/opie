# Changelog

All notable changes to Opie are documented here. This project uses
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [0.1.0] — 2026-06-08

First packaged release.

### Added
- Installable Python package `opie` with console commands:
  - `opie` — run the HTTP→OSC relay
  - `opie-gui` — the **Opie Control** Tkinter panel
  - `opie-sniff` — loopback OSC sniffer for safe dry runs
- **Opie Control** desktop GUI: edit config, Start/Stop/Restart, toggle
  autostart at login (launchd), live log tail, send-a-command test box,
  console-reachability check, and iPhone Shortcut setup helper.
- `install.command` / `uninstall.command` double-click installers (venv + GUI).
- Config now lives in `~/Library/Application Support/Opie/config.json`
  (auto-created on first run with a freshly generated token); logs in
  `~/Library/Logs/Opie/`.
- GitHub Actions CI running the test suite.

### Changed
- Restructured the `relay/` scripts into an importable `opie` package with
  relative imports (removes the old `sys.path` hacks and the `parser` stdlib
  name clash).

### Security
- No secrets in the repo: the shipped `config.example.json` uses placeholders,
  and the live config (with your token) is kept outside the tree and gitignored.
